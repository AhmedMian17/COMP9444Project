    "# Friday Something Flappy Bird AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Flappy bird is a mobile game which became hugely popular in early 2014. In the game, the player controls a bird tasked with flying between gaps of green pipes. The bird continuously falls downwards, unless the player taps the screen, giving the bird a short burst of upwards speed. The goal of this project is to develop an artificial intellegence that can play Flappy Bird at a level comparable to or beyond a regular human player.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that nature of the problem, reinforcement learning is the most appropriate learning paradigm. The task will be for the AI to, given some input, determine whether or not to \"flap\" at each frame. Every frame the bird does not crash into a pipe or the floor, the AI will be granted a reward of 1. This will encourage the AI to survive as long as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Analysis of Reinforcement Learning Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is resonably simple, the main decision to make is what input should be given for the AI. There are two options:\n",
    "1. Take a screenshot of the game, and use a convolutional neural network to extract important features (player, obstacles)\n",
    "1. Directly use player position and obstacle position as inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "It was chosen to use the second option as it would make the model simpler, could train faster as there is no need to draw graphics, and likely converge in fewer iterations as the model does not need to first learn what features are important. Seven inputs where given to the model, these were:\n",
    "- First pipe x coordinate\n",
    "- First pipe y coordinate\n",
    "- Second pipe x coordinate\n",
    "- Second pipe y coordinate\n",
    "- Player y coordinate\n",
    "- Player y velocity\n",
    "- Whether or not the player flapped on the previous frame\n",
    "In the NEAT Model these seven inputs were adequate, but in the Q-Learning model these inputs of the previous three frames where also given, totalling 28 inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the task was a non-episodic reinforcement learning problem it was necessary to use models that could train under these conditions. Some of the options available included:\n",
    "- Value Function Learning\n",
    "    - TD-Learning\n",
    "    - Q-Learning\n",
    "        - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)\n",
    "        - Double DQN\n",
    "- Policy Learning\n",
    "    - Evolutionary Strategies\n",
    "        - Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "        - NEAT\n",
    "    - Policy Gradients\n",
    "- Actor-Critic\n",
    "\n",
    "NEAT and Q-Learning were chosen because of the precedent of these methods being used for similar tasks."

    "## NEAT Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) Algorithm is a variation of the Genetic Algorithm approach, developed by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen in 2002 [1]. Like the Genetic Algorithm, the general approach is to generate a population of random models. Each model is then given a fitness value, depending on how well it performs at a particular task. A new population is then made through a combination operator and a mutation operator. The combination operator takes two (or more) models and combines then, and the mutation operator takes a single model and changes it slightly. The models with higher fitness are more likely to be combined with other models for the next generation, which should increase the average fitness. \n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional Genetic Algorithm approach relies on a fixed model topology, such that only the weights of the model are modified. In contrast, the NEAT algorithm begins with a simplified model, such as input nodes connecting directly to output nodes, and evolves the topology of the models too. New neurons and connections are added to existing models through the mutation operator. To keep track of the evolving model topologies, each model is assigned a set of node genes and a set of connection genes. Each gene is given a unique innovation number. When combining models, only genes with the same innovation number are combined.\n",
    " \n",
    "The NEAT algorithm also employs a technique called Speciation, where the population is grouped into species of similar topologies. Models are then more likely to be combined with other models of the same species. This helps maintain diversity in the population and prevents early convergence to a suboptimal solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 2006 study by Taylor, Whiteson and Stone [2] compared the NEAT algorithm to a temporal difference method SARSA. The study found that NEAT could find a better policy than SARSA, although it required more iterations to do so. The study also found that SARSA performed better when the domain was fully observable and NEAT converged quicker with a deterministic fitness function. Overall NEAT is shown to be a highly competitive algorithm for reinforcement learning.\n"

    "The training terminated after about 120 generations. Given that each generation had 150 models, the total number of models generated was 18000. The best model was run 1000 times to get a more accurate assessment of its performance. The mean fitness was 479, the median fitness was 234, and the standard deviation was 546. The graph below shows a histogram of the fitness of the 1000 runs.\n",

    "Noticeably 259 (~26%) of runs had a fitness of 86, which occurs when the model fails to get past the first pipe. The best run had a fitness of 3823. At 30 frames per second, this is equivalent to surviving for about 127 seconds.\n",

    "### NEAT Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The NEAT Algorithm resulted in a model that performed reasonably well, although with quite a large variance. With a median fitness of 234, this is equivalent to surviving for 7.8 seconds, which is similar to the performance of an average human player. Further training would likely improve the model further, but more care should be taken to avoid outlier runs from overestimating the performance of the model. This could be done by taking the median of a number of runs rather than the mean. Increasing the number of runs each model is tested on would also help reduce inaccuracy in performance evaluation, but this comes with an increase in training time. One approach could be to start with only a single run, and increase the number of runs with subsequent generations. This would help prevent multiple runs being wasted on early models that consistently perform poorly."
